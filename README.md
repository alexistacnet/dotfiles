# Firark dotfiles

Here are my dotfiles. Everything is made to be consistent accross applications and devices. I use the *Firark colors* everywhere, that you can find here : [https://github.com/alxkt/firark-colors](https://github.com/alxkt/firark-colors).

Installation can be easily managed with the `deploy.sh` script.
